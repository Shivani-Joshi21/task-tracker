# Task Tracker

A simple task tracker app that lets users **add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks**, and keep track of pending tasks. Completed tasks are moved to the end of the list with a strikethrough, and users can unmark them to return them to the pending list.

---

## Features
- Add new tasks with a description
- Mark tasks as complete or uncomplete
- Delete tasks

- Persistent task list (if using local storage in the app)
